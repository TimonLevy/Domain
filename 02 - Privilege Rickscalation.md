# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

**Privilege escalation** is a technique used by an attacker to get elevated privileges over the network/domain/host machine and be able tp perform more attacks. An attack might want to perform privilege escalation in oder to get access to *local admin*\\*system* privileges or even domain\enterprise admin privileges.

```diff
-just the privileges you noted are elevated? explain what are elevated privileges
```

## How Can It Be Done?

Privilege escalation techniques exploit human mistakes or code exploits. 
```diff
-what do you mean by human mistakes?
```

* An attacker might get local\domain admins credentials from local password cache (Pass-The-Hash/Ticket).
* An attacker might exploit kernel code bugs to make their code run in system privileges.
* An attacker might employ malware that an perform privilege escalation.
* An attacker might find the credentials on the network / perform bruteforcing methods.
* An attacker might perform a social engineering techniques in order to get the password from the user.
* An attacker might literally be an omniscient being and just know the password `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.

```diff
-give an example for each technic 
-don't use words like "might" and "maybe" when explaining a term or giving an example (say he can\would)
```
