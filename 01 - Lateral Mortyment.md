# LATERLAL MOVEMENT

Lateral movement is a technique employed by attackers to expand their control over a network. Lateral movement may be used as a way to get to a traget, collect useful information (like files) or even create a botnet.
Lateral movement can be performed using spear-phishing, pass-the-ticket/hash, session hijacking or exploiting valnurabilities.

## When Will We See Lateral Movement?

Lateral movement is a technique that is useful and coul be deployed to achieve almost anything. Most importantly the goal of lateral movement is to **get a better grip in the network**, classic use of lateral movement is when using worm malware that spreads across the network. Other use cases include: finding machines that have cached credentials, Sabotaging target machines/systems, hopping segments, creating botnets, spreading spyware and even more.
