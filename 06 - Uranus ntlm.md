## WHAT DOES UR ANUS HAVE TO DO WITH NTLM
Well, there is a slight commonality between the two.<br>
You see that is that NTLM hashes allow for ntlm relay attacks, which in their core are Man in the middle attacks.<br>
And the same goes for your butthole, it allows for a man in the middle. And I am sure if we run tcpdump on ur anus we will find evidence of some.

## Now for real...
Uranus is a malware from team Matrix's great scenario [Galaxy], in which the malware sniffs SMB communications, extracts NTLM hashes from the packets and sends them over to be cracked offline.<br>
