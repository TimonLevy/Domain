What does Mati Kaspi mean when he says "Klavlav Oh Bidi bam bam"?

In my honest opinion, these are instructions for the so called "Klavlav". A spy...
Mati Kaspi is leading a cell of Iranian spies in the country and directing them using children songs.

The Code "Oh Bidi Bam Bam" is made up of multiple parts:

* Oh - Prepare
* Bidi Bam - Target Code Name
* Bam - Destroy

Meaning, "Prepare to destroy this target".

Mati Kaspi repeats the words "Bidi" and "Bam", many times during the song. Possibly marking multiple targets.

```diff
-damn.. do we know what are some of the targets?
