What does Mati Kaspi mean when he says "Klavlav Oh Bidi bam bam"?

In my honest opinion, these are instructions for the so called "Klavlav". A spy...
Mati Kaspi is leading a cell of Iranian spies in the country and directing them using children songs.

The Code "Oh Bidi Bam Bam" is made up of multiple parts:

* Oh - Prepare
* Bidi - Target Code Name
* Bam Bam - Destroy

Meaning, "Prepare to destroy this target".


Mati Kaspi repeats the words "Bidi" and "Bam", many times during the song. Possibly marking multiple targets.

-DAMN.. do we know what some of the targets are?

According to intelligence here is a list of possible targets:
1. Yakira the Janitor
2. Mark Russinovich
3. David Andrew J. "Andy" Samberg
4. Ye
5. J.K. Rowling
6. Pewdiepie
