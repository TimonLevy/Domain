I hereby provide the investigation evidence until now.

**NUMBER ONE: Ironman rubber ducky.**

This duck is a technological wonder, brought to the present from the hit movie "Iron Duck 2" from the duck universe. it is a very fun and enjoyable prop to have for all Iron man and duck enjoyers out there.

**NUMBER TWO: Black Classic Duck**

This duck is the anti-racism duck, it symbolized hope and prosperity in a future where duck-kind isn't seperated by race and color bu united strong together in brotherly love.<br>
Sadly that reality belongs in the duck universe and not here, since humans are fucking idiots.

**NUMBER THREE: Cactus Duck**

It is a duck I found in my girlfriend's house, originally belonging to her sister. It is used to symbolize rejection, the green color often associated with disgust, the thorns which do not allow anymore to touch it -<br>
- and the fact he is a cactus which grows in the barren deserts make it a candidate for one of the most lonely ducks ever. Or it is just a cute duck modeled after a cactus (But I don't think so!).
